### Requirement: Transform Allocation Data
The composable MUST transform store data into structures suitable for a Donut Chart.

#### Scenario: Generate Allocation Data
- **WHEN** the store has holdings
- **THEN** `allocationData` provides a transformed array with `label`, `value`, and `color` properties for each holding

### Requirement: Transform Performance Data
The composable MUST transform store data into structures suitable for a Line Chart.

#### Scenario: Generate Performance Data
- **WHEN** performance history is requested
- **THEN** `performanceData` generates a synthetic history array based on the `total_equity`

### Requirement: Rebuild Action
